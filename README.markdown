# pystreamgraph

pystreamgraph's goal is to provide a simple way to generate __stream graphs__
using python.  The user is expected to provide formated data (a list of a list 
of tuples) and colors and labels. The engine will then print out an svg of the 
stream graph to the desired size and using one of several algorithms.

**Currenlty (2010/4/5) a work in progress**

## Installation

Not really "installable" yet. 

### Dependencies 

* Python
* [svgfig][1]

### Test Run

To start out do this:

    $ chmod +x test.py
    $ ./test.py
    
And see what happens. (It should print out several .svg graphics in the 
directory you're in)

Dig into **test.py** and see what works.
