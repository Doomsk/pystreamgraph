pystreamgraph
=============

pystreamgraph's goal is to provide a simple way to generate *stream graphs*
using python.  The user is expected to provide formated data (a list of a list 
of tuples) and colors and labels. The engine will then print out an svg of the 
stream graph to the desired size and using one of several algorithms.

**Currenlty (2010/4/5) a work in progress**

Installation
============

Using pip::

    $ pip install pystreamgraph

From source::
